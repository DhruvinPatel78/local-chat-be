# Backend Redeploy Instructions

## Issue: File Upload Returning Null
Your backend is not processing file uploads because the updated code with multer hasn't been deployed to Render.com yet.

## Solution: Redeploy Backend

### Step 1: Go to Render.com Dashboard
1. Open https://dashboard.render.com
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find your backend service (local-chat-be)

### Step 2: Trigger Manual Deploy
1. Click on your backend service
2. Go to the "Manual Deploy" section
3. Click "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
After deployment, test the file upload:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@test.txt" https://local-chat-be.onrender.com/upload
```

You should get a JSON response like:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "filename": "timestamp-random-originalname",
  "originalName": "test.txt",
  "size": 123,
  "mimetype": "text/plain"
}
```

### Step 4: Test Frontend
1. Your frontend is already running on http://localhost:5174/
2. Open the chat app
3. Try sending a file
4. It should work now!

## Alternative: Force Redeploy via Git
If manual deploy doesn't work, you can force a redeploy by making a small change:

```bash
cd local-chat-be
echo "# Updated $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Force redeploy for file upload fix"
git push origin main
```

This will trigger an automatic redeploy on Render.com.

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend code has multer dependency
- ✅ Frontend is configured correctly
- ❌ Backend needs redeployment
- ⏳ Waiting for Render.com to deploy changes
